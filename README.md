Chat App Example
=============================

This is an example of chating system using PHP and centrifugo for message delivery. If you have simple chatting
between users, then it is not profitable to write it by your own. Use some third-party services instead. But if you
have some specific business requirements then it can be useful to have all this chatting system at your side.
 
In this example we will have two different types of conversations:

 - Ordinary conversations between users (i.e. between friends);
 - Support system to allow users ask help from support team.
 
Both chatting solutions should support rich content (attachments), group chats and so on. Support system should be able
to assign specific conversation to support team member.
